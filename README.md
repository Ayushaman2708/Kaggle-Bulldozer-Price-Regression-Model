# Introduction
Bulldozers are essential pieces of equipment in construction and earthmoving industries. Accurately predicting their prices is crucial for making informed decisions related to buying, selling, or renting these machines. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to create a predictive model capable of estimating bulldozer prices based on various features.

# Dataset
Looking at the dataset from Kaggle, you can you it's a time series problem. This means there's a time attribute to dataset.

In this case, it's historical sales data of bulldozers. Including things like, model type, size, sale date and more.

There are 3 datasets:

1. Train.csv - Historical bulldozer sales examples up to 2011 (close to 400,000 examples with 50+ different attributes, including SalePrice which is the target variable).
2. Valid.csv - Historical bulldozer sales examples from January 1 2012 to April 30 2012 (close to 12,000 examples with the same attributes as Train.csv).
3. Test.csv - Historical bulldozer sales examples from May 1 2012 to November 2012 (close to 12,000 examples but missing the SalePrice attribute, as this is what we'll be trying to predict).

# Methodology
The predictive model is built using the following methodology:

1. Data Preprocessing: Missing values are imputed, categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are normalized to prepare the dataset for modeling.
2. Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected based on their importance in predicting bulldozer prices.
3. Model Selection: Several machine learning algorithms, including random forest, gradient boosting, and linear regression, are evaluated to identify the best-performing model.
4. Model Training: The selected model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using appropriate training techniques.
5. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess its performance in predicting bulldozer prices.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters of the chosen model are fine-tuned to optimize its performance further.
